###  My Current Interests and Skills

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/nolan/24/react-native.png"/> **React** - Frontend development has become one of my favorite things to work on, and I strongly believe that no other framework can top React.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/javascript.png"/> **Javascript & Typescript** - TS is my goto for both frontend and backend development. 

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/apple-phone.png"/> **React Native** - A lot of my work ([Wallo](https://github.com/JS00001/wallo-mobile), [CampusRush](https://github.com/JS00001/campusrush-mobile), [Trackwyse](https://github.com/trackwyse)) has revolved around mobile work for the last four years. 

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/nolan/24/react-native.png"/> **Node.js** - Used for almost all of my backend codebases. While I've worked with Go, Python, Php, etc, I've always circled back to my roots.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/mongodb.png"/> **MongoDB** - Controversial opinion, MongoDB provides a better developer experience, and better tooling than PostgreSQL. Sure, certain databases have advantages in specific situations, but MongoDB has always been great for my use-cases.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/python.png"/> **Python** - I've made my fair share of Python backends, along with scripts for data manipulation. Not one of my go-to languages, but I have a lot of experience with it all the same.
